# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification with FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **Machine Learning model** as a **web API** using **FastAPI**.  
The model predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset in machine learning with 150 flower samples.  
Each flower is classified into one of three species:

- Setosa ðŸŒ±
- Versicolor ðŸŒ¿
- Virginica ðŸŒ¸

The task is to build a model that accurately classifies the species given the four input features.

## ðŸ§  Model Choice

We used a **RandomForestClassifier** from scikit-learn because:

- It works well with small datasets
- Provides good accuracy and interpretability
- Reduces overfitting using bagging

The model was trained on 80% of the dataset and evaluated on 20% test data.  
The model was serialized using `joblib` and loaded in the FastAPI app for inference.
